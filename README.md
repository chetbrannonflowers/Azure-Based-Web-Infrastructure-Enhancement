# Azure-Based-Web-Infrastructure-Enhancement
This project focuses on developing and securing a cloud-based web application to host a cyber blog. It aims to provide a secure platform for sharing cybersecurity insights and updates.

Cloud Setup Overview:
•The cloud infrastructure is built on robust Azure services, ensuring high availability and scalability. Key 
 components include Azure App Service for web hosting and Azure SQL Database for data storage.

Components and Functionality:
•The web application utilizes a Flask framework for backend logic and Bootstrap for frontend design, 
 ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface. Authentication and authorization are managed using 
 Azure Active Directory for enhanced security.

Traffic and Security:
•HTTPS traffic is enforced using Azure Front Door for secure communication. Role-based access control 
 (RBAC) is implemented to manage user permissions effectively. Regular security audits and updates 
 maintain the application’s integrity.

The Secure Cyber Blog Web Application project establishes a resilient platform for disseminating cybersecurity knowledge. By leveraging Azure’s services and adhering to best security practices, the application ensures reliable performance and robust protection against potential threats.
